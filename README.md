A Unity Editor Window Experiment 
  </b></p>
This projects is purely for fun that may come in handy when making games. This may not be all that useful when actually making games but its fun seeing what you can do with the unity editor window and make convenient tools for it.

# Setup

Just add the script to your unity project, then go to the <b>Window</b> tab and select the <b>J-Tools</b> option. From there you can dock the tab just like any other unity editor window. Thats it :)
